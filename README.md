# Datumo
Datumo is a mini-algorithm that calculates how long ago a date was in days.


# Why isn't it a bot?
Because a bot is a program that communicates with the user in some way, but an algorithm is used by a bot to perform tasks, such as calculations. One could say that these five Python snippets constitute an algorithm.

# Other information
Datumo consists of 5 lines of code if the code is made completely compact.
Line 10 is where the actual work of the algorithm takes place.
